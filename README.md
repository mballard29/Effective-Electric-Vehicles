# Measuring the Effectiveness of Electric Vehicles based on Environmental Impact, Cost-Effectiveness, and Reliability

Group research term paper for "Data Science"

written by Mason Ballard, Holly Jordan, Chris Pierre-Paul, Chris Que, Sophia Villalonga


### My roles, responsibilities, and accomplishments:
* Conducted research evaluating how effective electric vehicles were compared to traditional combustion 
engine vehicles in minimizing the environmental impact, minimizing short- and long-term costs to the 
consumer, and relative reliability over time.
* Acting as a data scientist, collected relevant and varied data sources, compiling them, and performing 
data cleaning and normalization using Python scripts, MySQL Workbench, the mysql-connector module, 
Jupyter Notebooks, and matplotlib. I chose appropriate modeling algorithms based on the complexity of 
the dataset and the required specificity of the modelâ€™s predictions. I utilized these models as well as 
other visualizations I made to clearly and comprehensively compare electric vehicles to combustion 
engine vehicles. 
* Acting a technical writer, used precise yet simple language to summarize finds, highlight insights, make 
authoritative and informed recommendations, and make suggestions for further research. 
* Received an A on the paper and on the class.


### Tools:
* Written in LaTex using Overleaf
* Data collected, cleaned, normalized using Python, mysql-connector module, and Jupyter Notebooks
* Exploratory data analysis completed and models and visualizations made using matplotlib and scikit-learn
* Data stored in MySQL Workbench database
